    "Q1) There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. Behind the lockers are monsters. On round 1, you go through the lockers and open every single one. On round 2, you go through the lockers and shut every second. On round 3, you go through the lockers and toggle every third. On round N, you go through the lockers and toggle every Nth. After 100 rounds, the monsters will exit the open lockers and attack. How many monsters will there be attacking you?\n",

You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results are negative). However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?\n",
